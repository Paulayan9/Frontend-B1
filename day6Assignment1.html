<p>
    <Ul>

        <li>
            A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
				Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
				was born on October 15, 1931, in
				Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
        </li> 
    <br><br>
				<li>

                    He served as the 11th President
                    of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
                </li> 
				<li>

                    Kalam earned a degree in
                   aeronautical engineering from the
                   Madras Institute of Technology and in
                   1958 joined the Defence Research and
                   Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
                </li>
				<li>

                    In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation, where he
                    was project director of the SLV-III, the
                    first satellite launch vehicle that was
                    both designed and produced in India.
                </li> 
				<br><br> <li>

                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                   Kalam planned the program that produced
                   a number of successful missiles, which
                   helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                   “Missile Man.”</strong>
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    Among those successes
                   was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                   ballistic missile, which incorporated
                   aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                   in 1989.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    He also played a
                   pivotal organisational, technical,
                   and political role in India's Pokhran-II
                   nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                   the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
                   was scientific adviser to the defense
                   minister, and he later served as principal
                   scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
                   government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    His prominent role in
                   the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                   solidified India as a nuclear power and
                   established Kalam as a national hero,
                   although the tests caused great concern
                   in the international community.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    In 1998 Kalam put
                   forward a countrywide plan called
                   Technology Vision 2020, which he described
                   as a road map for transforming India from
                   a less-developed to a developed society
                   in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                   other measures, increasing agricultural
                   productivity, emphasizing technology as
                   a vehicle for economic growth, and
                   widening access to health care and
                   education.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    Kalam received <b>7</b>
                   honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>

                   honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
                   in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
                   in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and

                   to the Government.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>
                In 1997, Kalam received
               India's highest civilian honour, the
               Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
               the scientific research and modernisation
               of defence technology in India.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    In 2013, he was the

                   excellence in the management and leadership
                   of a space-related project".
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    While delivering a
                    lecture at the Indian Institute of
                    Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                    died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
                    <b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.
                </li> 
				<br><br> <li>

                    Wheeler Island, a
                   national missile test site in Odisha, was
                   renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
                   2015.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    A prominent road in
                   New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb
                   Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b>
                   in August 2015.
                </li>
				<br><br> <li>

                    In February 2018,
                   scientists from the Botanical Survey
                   of India named a newly found plant
                   species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
                   honour.
