      <li>Get outside for Labor Day and do your cooking on the grill, whether that means stacking these chicken-and-mushroom burgers high or serving these easy lemony fish kebabs. The important thing is, grill something effortless today, and while you’re at it, be sure to also grill the zucchini and eggplant that you need for tomorrow night’s pasta. These two recipes are flexible, too: If you don’t have ground chicken for the burgers, you can also use ground turkey or pork. If you’re feeling fish kebabs, you’re not stuck with salmon: Any thick fillet, like halibut, swordfish, or striped bass will grill well.</li>

         </ul>

      <li>There’s a simple recipe from Epi's food editor emeritus Anna Stockwell linked above, but you can definitely just wing this one. Here’s the gist: Slice grilled veggies into bite-sized pieces (hopefully you grilled them yesterday, but if not, you can take a breather from the kitchen to do it now). Mix with chunks of ripe tomatoes, a little oil and vinegar, fresh herbs, and mozzarella. No grilled zucchini and eggplant on hand? You could easily sub in a can of chickpeas or white beans, or blanched green beans, or just some more tomatoes.</li>

         </ul>

      <li> Breakfast for dinner is an Easiest Week Ever tradition, and it works as a midweek reset for the brain. Everyone feels a little better digging into waffles or a savory Apple-Cheddar Dutch Baby, drizzled with maple syrup and dashed with hot sauce. The latter recipe comes from Jenna Helwig’s Bare Minimum Dinners, a newly published resource that’s packed full of quick and easy weeknight meals.</li>

         </ul>

        <h3 class="recipe">Recipes:</h3>
      <li>Even if you don’t actually leave home, you can declare it picnic dinner night. The only rule is that you don’t really need forks—everything has to be eaten with your hands. Steaming green beans and shrimp while whipping up a tangy, herby dip is surprisingly quick. Crunchy lettuce and avocado round out the meal, though you could add any raw vegetables that you have around.</li>

         </ul>

      <li>Chetna Makan’s 30 Minute Indian is full of quick and easy recipes—while I rarely try a new recipe on a weeknight, it was no trouble at all to whip up a big pot of her cashew-enriched, cinnamon-scented Chicken Korma on a Thursday. And this vibrant green dal is even easier: You’ll just simmer split moong dal with ground turmeric and fresh ginger for about ten minutes, then add fresh spinach leaves. (If your container is five ounces instead of seven, life goes on; if it’s 16 ounces, just use half.) Once the spinach has wilted, blitz the mix with an immersion blender (or put in a blender or food processor) until creamy, then swirl in yogurt and top with chile-flecked onions crisped in ghee.</li>

         </ul>

      <li>Today is all about a flexible meal that starts with rice. Each of the recipes above can take on whatever toppings you have—raw or cooked vegetables that need to be used, crisp chopped bacon or salty-sweet sausage, shredded rotisserie chicken, an egg, any bits and bobs, some crunchy chopped nuts, crispy shallots, a drizzle of chili crisp.</li>

         </ul>

      <li>This meatless chili from Epi contributor Mindy Fox and Queer Eye star Antoni Porowski’s new cookbook, Let’s Do Dinner, serves four to six. But anytime I’m making a pot of chili, I double it—besides a little chopping, it’s basically the same amount of effort for twice as many meals. (This recipe takes just about 30 minutes to make, so that’s a pretty great deal.) Freeze whatever you don’t eat tonight, or serve the rest next week on top of baked potatoes, mixed into mac and cheese, or simply in a bowl again, loaded up with your favorite toppings. Porowski says he likes to top any leftovers with a fried egg for brunch. “This chili is incredibly simple to make,” he notes, “and it tastes as though it's been simmering for hours. The quinoa adds a fantastic texture and good amount of protein.” In addition to that quinoa, the recipe calls for a mix of cannellini and garbanzo beans, but you can sub whatever canned beans you have around.</li>
